### Ideas 

- Stock Market Fantasy League: The user selects 10 stocks in their portfolio and can join a league with their friends. Based on the performance of the stock, they get points and can compete against each other. Every week during the transfer period they can trade stocks to improve their portfolio 

- CineMatch: An application that enhances Netflix experience by connecting users with similar movie genre preferences. It recommends movie screening in nearby cinemas and informs about related local events, fostering social interactions among 'genre buddies.' The app personalized suggestions through continuous learning from users' viewing habits and preferences, bridging the gap between online streaming and real-world movie experiences.

- Travel Itinerary Planner: This website could make an exact itinerary for what people could do planned to the exact time and price. This website would take in the number of people and the dates of visiting a location and would make an exact itinerary for activities with time and price for proper planning. Further scope could be making filters for what kind of activities one might want to do.
